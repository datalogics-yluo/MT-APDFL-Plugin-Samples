/* There will be an expandable collection of thread worker method classes that may be run. 
** Each class will have an initialization method, that will set it's unique variables, from a command line array.
** Each class will have a "worker" method that will be executed for it's process.
**
** The command line controls processing. It may be written on the command line, or stored in a file, and the name 
**   of the file specified as the only entry on the command line. The file default_Commands.txt lists all possible commands, 
**   and thier default values. One simple way to make a new test is to copy that file, remove everything not needed for your 
**   test, and modify the remaining options into what your test requires.

**  These options control the overall processing:
**
**  "LogFile=" Gives the name of a file to hold a progress log. If this is given, the default for "silent" will change to "false".
**             if omitted, output will default to stdout.
**
**  "TotalThreads=" gives the total number of threads to run. Default is 100 threads.
**                  While this value, like any other, maybe a list, only the first value will be used.
**
**  "ActiveThreads=" gives the number of threads to be run at a given time. Default is 5.
**              Note that this will interact with the following command (PauseEvery) such that the number of active threads may be less than
**              this on occassion. The design of the thread pump is such that we will note only one thread terminated, before starting a new
**              thread, so generally, "ActiveThreads" threads will be running at any given moment. Though some of those threads may have compeleted
**              working.
**
**              The value here may be a list. This allows the test designer to vary the number of working threads over time. The values in the list
**              will be used one by one, as threads are started, and the list will be cycled through when it's end is reached.
**
**  "PauseEvery=" will cause the process to allow the active threads to fall to zero every N threads. The default value is zero,'
**              This simulates a random start/stop environment, in which we will sometimes have no active threads. Whenthe value is zro,
**              we will stop pausing.
**
**              The value here may be a list, in which case we will pause afte the first number in the list, then resume and pause after the
**              second, and so on. We will cycle back to the start of the list when values are exhausted. Note that a zero in the list will
**              cause us to stop pausing.
**
**  "BaseInit=" may be true or false. If true, the library is initialized in the base thread. Default is true,
**              Where ever possible, applications should initialize and terminate the library on the "base" thread. 
**              This does two things. It puts the bulk of the initialize and terminate time into the base thread, allowing
**              worker threads to process more quickly, and it prevents the library from completly closing, and requiring a 
**              complete reopen. The "secondary" open of the library, required on each thread, will them be much faster. We know that
**              in some environments there is no conceptual "base thread" the hang this init/term on. So we permit applications that
**              do not have a base initialization. However, these will perform markedly worse than applications which do have a base thread. 
**              one saving grace here is that if there are simulataneous threads of the library running, only the first to start must do the compelete
**              open, and only the last to finish must do the compelete close. Only one thread at a time may be opening or closing the library!
**
**              This value is singular. If a list is supplied, only the first entry will be used.

**  "Processes=" is a command seperator list, enclosed in brackets, naming each process to run, in the order they
**              are to be run. There may be only one, or there may be many. A given process name can be included in the list
**              more than once. Threads will be started in the order given here, repeating as the list is exhausted.
**
**  "TempMemFileSys=" may be true or false. If true, set default temp file sys to ASMemFileSys at startup.
**
**              You may wish to use this option if a point of contention is access to a disc drive for storing temporary files.
**
**  "Silent=" may be true or false. If true, this silences messages written from the framework (Though not, neccessarily from worker threads).
**          this defaults to true if logfile is not used, and false if logfile is used. Primarily, you may want this set to true to deaden
**          extranious I/O operations while testing. 
**
**   The following paths may be set, to allow the test bed to use libraries or resources which are not positioned as expected 
**    (It is expected to be a memnber of the distribution library CPlusPlus directory).
**   APDFLPath                      Where to find the libraries, default is ../Binaries
**   ResourcesPath                  Where to find resources, default is ../../Resources
**...PluginPath                     Where to find plugins, default is APDFLPath.
**   ColorsPath                     Where to find color profiles, defaults to ..\\..\\Resources\\Color\\Profiles
**...UnicodePath                    Where to find the Unicode Directory, defaults to ../../Resources/Unicode
**   CMapsPath                      Where to find the CMaps Directory, defaults to ../../Resources/CMaps
**
** In studying mutli-threading behaviour, it is useful to lok at changes in behaviour as different memory allocators are used.
** For this reason, we can change the memory allocator used by setting a command line value for MemoryManger. The list of 
** valid memory managers is maintained in Utilities.h, with the code to effect the change in utilities.cpp.
**   MemoryManger                   Which memory manager should APDFL Use? (Currently "None" (default), "malloc", "tcmalloc" (unimplemented), and "rpmalloc")
**
**  Each type of worker may have a set of options specified for it.
**    These are specified as a comma seperated series of keyword/value pairs, inside a set of brackets. The names should
**    be in the form "ProcessNameOptions".
**
**  These options are common to all workers. They do not all need to be used for all workers:
**
**  "InFileName="  The name of a file used for input in the process. If the file does not exist, the run will fail!
**
**          This may be a list of names. The first thread run will use the first name, the second the second name, and so on, 
**          cycling back to the start of the list. This canbe used to create asyymetric behaviour in threads, so that some do more
**          work than others. 
**
**  "InFile2Name=".. The name of a secondary input file. This may be used in workers that require 2 input files.It behaves as 
**           InFileName above.
**
**  "InFile3Name=".. The name of a tertiary input file. This may be used in workers that require 3 input files.It behaves as
**           InFileName above.
**
**  "OutFilePath="  The name of an directory to hold output. If there directory does not exist, it will be created.
**                       if the path to the directory does not exist, it will not be created, and the run will fail!
**
**          This may be a list of names. They will be used in order, the first output to the first path, the second to the second, and so on.

**  "Silent="  may be true of false. If true, the worker will write no messages to the display. Default is true.
**
**  "LoadPlugins=" may be true of false. Default is per worker class (Workers[]).
**
**          If your thread does not need to use plugins, setting this option true can save some time and contention in the Init/Term logic.
